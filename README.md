# ffix

### Description
Rust crate that provides fixed point data type(s) and analysis tools for fixed point code. This software package is intended as a tool for designing FPGA implementations of DSP algorithms.

### Next features to implement
- Rule for operations between Ffix operands with different word and/or fraction length
- Possibility to choose action to perform on overflow (maybe)
- analysis module, that will contain tools for choosing proper word and fraction lengths
