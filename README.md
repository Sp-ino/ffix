# ffix

### Description
Rust crate that provides fixed point data type(s). This software package is intended as a tool for designing FPGA implementations of DSP algorithms.

### Next features to implement
- Possibility to choose signedness
- Possibility to choose other rounding methods (maybe)
- Rule for operations between Ffix operands with different word and/or fraction length
- Ffix vectors
