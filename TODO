To-do list

- Add like() function that creates a Ffix with specified value and the same settings as another Ffix
- Think about the possibility of creating a signed and unsigned Ffix type to remove the first generic constant
  parameter and simplify syntax
- Find another name for compute_lims()
- Possibility to choose action to perform on overflow (warning, panic, and so on) (maybe)
- analysis module, that will contain tools for choosing proper word and fraction lengths (working on it)
